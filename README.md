# qb-apartments
A modification to the qb-apartments resource, to prevent players from being put into the same shell as other players. This is accomplished by not only creating additional apartment shells on the Z axis, but then also creating a new set of them on a new X offset at a certain limit. Should theoretically allow infinite players to enter the same apartment building at the same time.
